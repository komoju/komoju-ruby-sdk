      - New keys: `processing_fees_cents`
    - `refunds`:
      - Moved here:
        - `refund_total` now called `refunded_amount_total_cents`
        - `refund_fee_total` now called `refund_processing_fees_cents` and includes tax
        - `refunded_customer_fee_total` now called `refunded_customer_fees_cents` and includes tax

Refer to the API reference for the exhaustive list).
    - For each section, added a `total_cents` of each of its amounts.

- [`GET settlements` endpoint] Renamed one key name, added a number of new keys, and made changes to several returned values.

  - **Renamed keys**:
    - `amount` is now `settlement_amount_cents` in order to make the key more clear and less generic.
  
  - **Added keys**:
    - NOTE: values for keys ending in `_cents` are returned as integers (not strings); any integers related to fees can be negative integers.
    - `transaction_amount_cents`
    - `fee_amount_cents`
    - `fee_tax_amount_cents`
    - `fx_currency`
    - `fx_conversion_rate`
    - `fx_conversion_amount_cents`
    - `bank_transfer_fee_amount_cents`
    - `remittance_amount_cents`

  - **Return value changes**: 
    - `status`: "automatic_pending" is now returned as "pending".
    - `settlement_amount_cents` (formerly `amount`): the value of `settlement_amount_cents` is now returned as an integer rather than a string.
    - `download`: all keys in this section (such as `csv` or `xls`) will show "null" instead of a link if the settlement is cancelled. If the settlement is not cancelled, all links will point to an updated version of the report.

- [`GET settlements/:id` endpoint] Renamed two key names, added a number of new keys, made changes to several returned values, and transformed the response to a nested (2D) structure to include details for various kinds of payments and fees.

  - **Renamed keys**:
    - `amount` is now `settlement_amount_cents` in order to make the key more clear and less generic.

  - **Removed keys**:

    - `refund_total`
    - `refund_fee_total`

    - `tax_total`

    - `fee_tax_amount_cents`
    - `fx_currency`
    - `fx_conversion_rate`

    - `payments`, `refunds`, `platform_model`, `corrections`, `komoju_card_charges`, `disbursements`, `misc` sections (see `GET balances/:id` above for structure)

  - **Return value changes**: 
    - `download`: all keys in this section (such as `csv` or `xls`) will show "null" instead of a link if the settlement is cancelled. If the settlement is not cancelled, all links will point to an updated version of the report.
